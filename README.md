# movies
A function that stores information about movies inside an array. The movie's object info are name, director, and date. The program can receive several types of input:
•	"addMovie {movie name}" – add the movie
•	"{movie name} directedBy {director}" – check if the movie exists and then add the director
•	"{movie name} onDate {date}" – check if the movie exists and then add the date

At the end the program prints all the movies that have all the info (if the movie has no director, name, or date, doesn’t print it) in JSON format.
